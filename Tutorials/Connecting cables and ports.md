# Computer cables and ports

## Introduction

The document covers the types of **cables and ports** used to connect the computer components. A **port** enables peripheral devices to communicate with the computer. You could have different connecting cables and ports based on the make and manufacturing year of the machine. 

 

## Types of cables and ports

#### VGA Cable: The Video Graphics Array cable is used in computers for generating video output on the monitor. Essentially, it is a bridge between the computer and the monitor. VGA cable does not generate the audio output, you can either use a VGA to HDMI converter cable or connect the speakers as peripherals.
