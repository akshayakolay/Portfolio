## Prerequsities

* A desktop monitor and a CPU.
* Peripherals like mouse, keyboard and their connecting cables. [Refer here to locate the ports and connecting cables](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#types-of-cables-and-ports).

## Safety Guidelines

* Never connect the two extension cable together. As it may result in fire hazard.

* Do not switch off the CPU button directly. Follow the shut down process.


## Step 1- Set up a computer

1) Open the box/carton to find the desktop monitor, CPU and other components (mouse, keyboard).
2) Place the monitor, CPU, and peripherals on a flat surface (preferably on a table). Make sure to put everything in a well-ventilated area so that enough air is circulated around the components and the parts do not get heated up.

3) Find the [HDMI](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#hdmi-cable-the-high-definition-media-interface-cable-is-used-to-generate-both-the-audio-and-video-output-you-dont-need-any-speakers-as-peripherals-for-this-cable-as-this-cable-is-capable-to-provide-audio-transmission-as-well)/[VGA](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#vga-cable-the-video-graphics-array-cable-is-used-in-computers-for-generating-video-output-on-the-monitor-essentially-it-is-a-bridge-between-the-computer-and-the-monitor-to-generate-the-audio-output-you-can-either-use-a-vga-to-hdmi-converter-cable-or-connect-the-speakers-as-peripherals)/[DVI](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#dvi-cable-the-digital-visual-interface-cable-is-used-to-provide-video-display-on-the-monitor-to-get-audio-support-use-dvi-to-hdmi-converter-cable-or-connect-the-speakers-as-peripherals) cable. Connect one end to the monitor while the other end goes into the designated slot on the back of the computer.

4) Similarly, find [USB](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#usb-cable-the-universal-serial-bus-is-used-to-connect-any-usb-supported-deviceperipherals-to-the-computer) or [PS/2](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#ps2-cable-the-cable-is-used-to-connect-the-wired-keyboard-and-mouse-ps2-ports-on-the-computer-have-two-colour-codes) cables for the keyboard, and mouse. Connect one end to the keyboard/mouse and another end to the USB/PS2 slot provided on the computer.

5) Find the power supply cable and plug one end into a surge protector. It is recommended to use a surge protector to protct your computer from voltage fluctutations.

7) Turn on the PC.

## Step 2- Enable the firewall 

Now that you have set up the hardware. We will now enable the firewall.

A firewall is a security system that analyses internet traffic (incoming and outgoing). It restricts the traffic if found dangerous for your system and protects from potential threats and malware.

1) Turn On the computer.
2) If you have bought a pre-configured system, OS will be installed on it. You can directly start with the setup which generally includes, setting date and time, language preferences and other parameters to enhance the user experience. 
3) Go to **Start** > **Control Panel**
4) Select the **System Security** > **Windows Firewall**
5) Go to **Customize settings**, and enable the **Turn on Windows Firewall** option for both private and public network settings.

## Step 3- Configure and connect to the internet

* Using the ethernet cable
1) Locate and plug one end of the ethernet cable on the computer and another into the router. [Refer here to locate the ports and connecting cables](https://github.com/akshayakolay/Portfolio/blob/main/Tutorials/Connecting%20cables%20and%20ports.md#types-of-cables-and-ports)
* Using Wifi

1) Go to **Start**
2) Enter "Connect to network" in the search box.
3) Identify the network you want to connect to and click the box to **Connect Automatically** in future when in the range.
4) Enter the password to authenticate and click **Connect**.

## Step 4- Activate the antivirus

Once you have connected to the internet. Before using the internet for any purpose. Safeguard your computer from any malware or virus. 
The new system usually comes with pre-installed antivirus with a free trial subscription. The antivirus installation asks you for the activation code on starting for the first time. You usually recive it on your email or along with your purchase package. Provide the code and you are done.

If you prefer other antivirus you can go ahead to install a new one of your choice.

Note: windows 10 and 11 comes(windows security) inbuilt antivirus. That protects your system from you turn on the it. 

## Step 5- Update the windows and other software

It is considered a good practice to run a quick software and windows update. It helps to get you the latest version of programs and helps run the system smoothly.

1) Go to **Start**.
2) Enter "Windows Update" in the search box.
3) Click **Check for updates**.
4) Install the programs that are prompted and wait till the process is completed.

6) Restart the computer once done.
 
## Step 6- Start browsing the internet

Now, the hardware and software setup is done. You can proceed to use the internet.

1) Open the search engine (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
2) Type in “northvolt.com” in the search bar and click **Enter**.
