# All about API
## Introduction

Application Programming Interface abbreviated as API, is a software that acts as a medium through which the two applications exchange data between them.The APIs are used almost everywhere in the programs and you must have used such applications knowingly or unknowingly.

You might have observed that many sites have the option of “Sign in with Google/Facebook/Twitter/GitHub” on a site. Let us take an example that you choose to Sign in with Google account credentials to access Canva application. On the screen you might see just a button. But Canva is calling a Google API to authenticate whether you are a Google account user or not. An API response from Google’s server determines whether you are allowed to access it or not.

## History
APIs have been in use in some or the other form since the 1940s. The earliest evidence of using an API is while two scientists working on EDSAC, a computer. The scientists used to write and store the subroutines (the specific instructions to execute a program) in a punched paper.In the year 1968 the term Application Programming Interface got introduced. 

But the era of Web APIs began in 2005, and the concept of open Web APIs got popular in 2010. The rapid development in the sectors like e-commerce, social media,online travel, and etc gave a boom to this idea. The growing industries were in search of a mechanism that could cater to their needs and  the APIs were an exact match. The APIs are lightweight, cost efficient, and takes less time to implement and  make the application feature rich.

## APIs in Everyday life
* Weather apps.
* Google maps on food delivery, rideshare apps. 
* Flight information across travel booking sites and airline operator.
* Pay with PayPal/ pay with third party payment sitesl.
* Sign in with google/facebook/github/twitter account on a site.

## API with an analogy
To understand the concept of API, let us conside a waiter in a restaurant.

1) You go to a restaurant, the waiter comes to you and hand out the menu card. After going through the menu. 
2) You order the food and the waiter takes the order to the kitchen. The waiter tells the chef the dishes that needs to be prepared.
3) Once the order is ready, the waiter gets it.

This is the perfect example of how an API works.

The Roles:
* You- The application that has requested some information.
* Waiter-The way how waiter acts as a medium to communicate between you and the chef. Same way API communicates between the two applications. 
* Menu- information that needs to delieverd.
* Chef-  The another application from which you want the response. 

## Benefits
* Offer range of features- By using the APIs, the developing application gains instant access to some of the software functionalities of the already developed application.This way you can leverage and reuse the functionalities of other applications and make your application more feature rich.

* Reduce development cost: One of the reasons to use API is that the developers can build a new application with the reusable components. For example: The developer is in process of designing an application that provides information related to popular destination and how to get there, upcoming events in the city, weather update of the city, and etc. One of the features for e.g. reaching the destination can be developed by incorporating the google maps in the app. 

* Automate the process- The API can perform many activities without human intervention.  Such as extracting reports and sending it to the concerned person, creating roasters for employees, and also cutting down the number of software licenses required.

* Security- The safety of data is of prime importance for any orgaization. The API provides the measure to safeguard the data. One such example is the single sign in option. It helps the employee of an organization to use the same login credentials for various applications used inside an orgaization. This way the employee doesn not require to store the the credentials in any file/on desktop sticky notes.

## Types Of API
Add infographic

Private: They are for internal use within offices, organization, department.
Benefits: 	Better internal functioing
Efficient infrastructure
Reduction in the cost

Open: They are free to use but the parties using don’t have any business relation with each oth
Such APIs require authorization and also has a limit on how many times we can call an api.
Benefits: 	Low cost
Additional features
Used by technology enthusiast in spare time

Partner - They are limited in access and are exposed only to strategic associates.These APIs are either free or paid but have stringent authorization, authentication and security norms.
Benefits: 		Good strategic relation
     		Brand recognition
      		Increase revenue
