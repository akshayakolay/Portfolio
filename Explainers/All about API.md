# All about API
## Introduction

Application Programming Interface abbreviated as API, is a software that acts as a medium through which the two applications exchange data between them.The APIs are used almost everywhere in the programs and you must have used such applications knowingly or unknowingly.

You might have observed that many sites have the option of “Sign in with Google/Facebook/Twitter/GitHub” on a site. Let us take an example that you choose to Sign in with Google account credentials to access Canva application. On the screen you might see just a button. But Canva is calling a Google API to authenticate whether you are a Google account user or not. An API response from Google’s server determines whether you are allowed to access it or not.

## History
APIs have been in use in some or the other form since the 1940s. The earliest evidence of using an API is while two scientists working on EDSAC, a computer. The scientists used to write and store the subroutines (the specific instructions to execute a program) in a punched paper.In the year 1968 the term Application Programming Interface got introduced. 

But the era of Web APIs began in 2005, and the concept of open Web APIs got popular in 2010. The rapid development in the sectors like e-commerce, social media,online travel, and etc gave a boom to this idea. The growing industries were in search of a mechanism that could cater to their needs and  the APIs were an exact match. The APIs are lightweight, cost efficient, and takes less time to implement and  make the application feature rich.

## APIs in Everyday life
* Weather apps.
* Google maps on food delivery, rideshare apps. 
* Flight information across travel booking sites and airline operator.
* Pay with PayPal/ pay with third party payment sitesl.
* Sign in with google/facebook/github/twitter account on a site.

## API with an analogy
To understand the concept of API, let us conside a waiter in a restaurant.

**Add image**
1) You go to a restaurant, the waiter comes to you and hand out the menu card. After going through the menu. 
2) You order the food and the waiter takes the order to the kitchen. The waiter tells the chef the dishes that needs to be prepared.
3) Once the order is ready, the waiter gets it.

This is the perfect example of how an API works.

The Roles:
* You- The application that has requested some information.
* Waiter-The way how waiter acts as a medium to communicate between you and the chef. Same way API communicates between the two applications. 
* Menu- information that needs to delieverd.
* Chef-  The another application from which you want the response.
